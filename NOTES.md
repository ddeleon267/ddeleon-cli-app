  How to describe each location?
    Each location has a name, has a location, a distance away from you, and a list of beers

  How to describe each beer?
    Each beer has a name, each beer has notes/flavors, maybe a type, and alcohol percentage, a price

should probably change name to whats_on_tap_gem or whats-on-tap-gem. annoying.

How to actually make these objects "Real" e.g. by scraping? Would like to start with the zip but I don't know how that would work.

For right now maybe just go through and work on beer class?

Or/also, figure out the scraping for the beers, then the locations, then figure out the whole zipcode piece?

Basically just played with file structure and dependencies today
